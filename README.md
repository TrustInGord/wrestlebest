# WrestleBest
WrestleBest The Game

> Description
WrestleBest is a game where you vote for simulated wrestlers on who will win and who will lose. Players select their favourite winner and favoruite loser. There are several matches per day, and the more they win or lose the more you win. Rewards allow users to unlock features like playing in other regions or changing the rules of wrestling matches. Communal donations unlock other nations, or features like match types, or selecting multiple wrestlers. The game increases in scope as more is unlocked by player involvement.
