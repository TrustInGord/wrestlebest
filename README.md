WrestleBest The Game

> Description
WrestleBest is a game where you vote for simulated wrestlers on who will win and who will lose. Players select their favourite winner and favoruite loser. There are several matches per day, and the more they win or lose the more you win. Rewards allow users to unlock features like playing in other regions or changing the rules of wrestling matches. Communal donations unlock other nations, or features like match types, or selecting multiple wrestlers. The game increases in scope as more is unlocked by player involvement.

## Project Status

Project is: _in progress_

## Room for Improvement

Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.

Room for improvement:

- Impliment hometown bonus for matches (add and hometown to character?)
- Have fatigue be a negative to the match

To do:

- Add option to spend score for itmes
- Multiple User support?
- Timed game (Everyone guesses before timer)
- Maybe give wrestlers a type of wrestling style they perform as, but which gives them advantages and weakneses against other types.

  Just liked this wrestler code
